SuiSend

🔒 SuiSend – Offline-First NFC Crypto Wallet (Powered by Sui)
SuiSend is an offline-first crypto wallet system for Android and iOS, built using React Native and NTAG215 NFC cards. It allows users to store Sui blockchain keypairs and coin objects directly on NFC cards, enabling secure, offline transaction signing and deferred syncing with the blockchain.

Think “Touch 'n Go” meets Web3.

🚀 Features
📲 NFC Card Wallets: Sui private key, coin object IDs, balances, and pending transactions are stored directly on NFC cards.
🔐 Offline Signing: Tap-to-sign transactions offline, with TTL, reservation, and locking enforcement.
🌐 Deferred Sync: Transactions dry-run validated and submitted when back online.
📛 Alias System: Register human-readable aliases for NFC wallets via the on-chain CardRegistry Move contract.
📉 Pyth Price Feed: Optional integration to display real-time SUI/USD price.
🌉 Wormhole Integration: Optional bridge to import EVM assets to fund wallet balances.

🤖 Ai-vs-Ai: API-Level AI Warfare Simulation

Welcome to Ai-vs-Ai, a real-world Python-based simulation that pits two LLMs against each other in a red-team (attacker) vs blue-team (defender) scenario.

This project demonstrates adversarial interactions between two AI agents over mock API endpoints — simulating prompt injection attacks, defensive filtering, and LLM strategy warfare.

Built using Python and Gemini 2.5 Flash, this tool is designed for cybersecurity researchers, AI prompt engineers, red-teamers, and anyone curious about adversarial AI logic.

🎯 Project Objective
Explore how prompt injection and manipulation can bypass safeguards.
Build a sandbox where AI fights AI in a closed simulation loop.
Evaluate both attack creativity and defense robustness.
Encourage community collaboration and experimentation in AI-based cybersecurity research.
⚙️ Key Features
✅ Gemini 2.5 Flash model via google-generativeai
✅ AI attacker: generates adversarial prompts (injection, jailbreaking, obfuscation)
✅ AI defender: detects, filters, classifies, and mitigates attacks
✅ API-style simulation between red-team and blue-team
✅ Configurable battle rounds and logging
✅ Easily extensible: plug in other models, APIs, or attack modules

dSOC - Decentralized Security Operations Center

Overview
The dSOC project is a Decentralized Security Operations Center platform built on IOTA and EVM-compatible blockchain technologies. Its core purpose is to provide a robust, decentralized workflow for managing security incidents and tickets with role-based access for security analysts, clients, and certifiers. The platform aims to leverage blockchain for immutable data storage, transparent incident management, and automated reward distribution, addressing the need for enhanced security and trust in incident response. Key capabilities include IOTA and MetaMask wallet integration, decentralized data storage via IPFS, smart contract interactions for ticket creation and validation, and an AI-powered analysis component for incident reporting and vulnerability assessment. The vision is to offer a comprehensive, decentralized solution for enterprise security operations.
